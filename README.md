This software is a small tool for pentesting and network analysis, the present version of the program isn't finish and
i need to work on the framework too. If you wan't to run the script, please install the last version of the perl interpreter on
http://www.perl.org. I currently work for publishing my framework on metacpan (official packet manager of perl) and i'll give you
all informations about the update and the news. This tool is entierely open source so you can use it whatever you wan't on your 
professional projects. If you have any issues with the execution, check your network settings. For the linux and macos users 
this version is not compatible due to the libs and the ASCII system, i work on a public lib for linux and macos.
Good use!
